# ü§ñ Discord AI Selfbot

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org)-based Discord selfbot using the `discord.py-self` library. The selfbot automatically responds to all DMs and holds conversations using Groq API's Llama-3, one of the highest performing models, **all for completely free**. You can also add your own API key for ChatGPT functionality, but this is not required. It functions as a normal Discord bot, but on a real Discord account, allowing other people to talk to it within DMs, servers and even group chats without you needing to invite a bot or add the bot to the server - making it seem like a real user to others.

> There is always the slight risk of a ban when using selfbots, so make sure to use this selfbot on an account you don't mind losing, but the risk is incredibly low and I have used it for over a year without any issues.

> Note: This analysis is based on the user's message history and is obviously not accurate at all. It is just for fun and should not be taken seriously.
